# Introduction to Software Project Management (SPM)

**Software Project Management (SPM)** is a specialized branch of project management that focuses on the planning, execution, monitoring, and control of software projects. It involves coordinating resources, managing timelines, and ensuring that software projects meet their objectives within the constraints of time, budget, and quality¬π.

Key aspects of SPM include:

1. **Planning**: Defining the scope, objectives, and deliverables of the project.
2. **Scheduling**: Creating a timeline for project activities and milestones.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Assigning tasks and resources to team members.
4. **Execution**: Implementing the project plan and developing the software.
5. **Monitoring and Control**: Tracking progress, managing risks, and making necessary adjustments to stay on track.
6. **Delivery**: Ensuring the final product meets the requirements and is delivered on time¬≤¬≥.
